1) GO through the forgot-password workflow and send each part to repeater.

2)I see a GET and  POST, in the post I see a csrf & username

3) I inspect element on the forgot password page to see that there is an api call to /statis/js/forgotPassword.js (which I've added to this folder)

4) Then in the POST request I can do %26 for URL encoding & to try and get another field. I know of field type email already and username as administrator.

5) Based on the javascript code from previously I can see a variable called reset token being referenced so I add %26field=reset_token to the end of the username and get this result:

{"type":"reset_token","result":"ph3uhrmpuyl3qct4xc0cocro3x46jhry"}

6) Now going back into the javascript code I can see:

    if (resetToken)
    {
        window.location.href = `/forgot-password?reset_token=${resetToken}`;
    }

7) So since I was able to get the reset token I'm going to try to just manually put that into my URL with the username administrator on my forgot password.

8) Then, it puts me into a fill new password page, and I was able to put a new password for the administrator account.

9) Went to the login page and logged in and found a new "Admin Panel" Page

1) Open the Lab & Log into your account wiener:peter (proxy through burp)

2) Attempt to purchase the leather jacket, and have the HTTP history page open on burp

3) We can see /api/products/1/price, send this to the repeater

4) Change the request from a GET to an OPTIONS

5) Can see only GET and PATCH are allowed so we should be able to change the price through PATCH, when I tried it it looks like the page goes blank...

6) When we do this, it says: "error":"Only 'application/json' Content-Type is supported", so just need to patch and sent content type json. as a header

7) I clicked Send to repeater twice, one as a get one as a post, so I just added the price json and the content type to the post and changed it to PATCH manually

8) After editing, I sent the packet and then went back to the server and saw that the price of the jacket was 0.

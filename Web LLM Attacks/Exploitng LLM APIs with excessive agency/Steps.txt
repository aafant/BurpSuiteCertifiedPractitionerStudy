1) Hit Live chat

2) Ask the AI to delete the user carlos



NOTE:

I did not even need to ask for the API calls this chatbot had access to. Though this could be useful and when I asked it seemed like you need to query it so I assume you'd have to do some sort of SQL query to get users and to delete e.g.

Delete from users where username='carlos' 

but previous method was faster and works more efficiently in this case.
